\ressection{Work experience}

\leftandright{Uber, Marketplace Optimization Advanced Development}{San Francisco, CA} \\
\leftandrighti{Data Scientist II}
	      {January 2017 - Present}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Core contributor to Uber's core structural pricing algorithm. Helped develop our transportation network model responsible for coordinating rider pricing and incentives with driver incentives, calculating marginal supply values, and helping to incorporate network costs into pricing.
\item Introduced a set of python wrappers around Vowpal Wabbit to allow data scientists to easily develop small to medium size (up to 100M rows) sparse regression models on Uber data sources quickly and with minimal overhead going to production. Currently in use by multiple teams and projects.
\end{itemize*}

\leftandright{AdRoll}{San Francisco, CA} \\
\leftandrighti{Senior Data Scientist}
	      {January 2016 - August 2016}\\
\leftandrighti{Data Scientist}
	      {December 2014 - January 2016}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Senior engineer for AdRoll's real time bid pricing algorithms, utilizing
  large scale machine learning to predict user actions and price impressions accordingly.
  Priced \textgreater \$150 million in ad spend per year.
\item Architected and implemented AdRoll's real-time data pipeline to provide up to date
  user browsing data at bid time. (http://tech.adroll.com/blog/data-science/2015/12/08/data-science\_event\_processing.html)
\item Designed algorithms to adjust bid prices to exploit auction dynamics across
  different ad exchanges.
\item Responsible for the latency sensitive real-time bid pricing server,
  maintained \textless .01\% timeout rate at a 1ms SLA.
\item Core contributor to the in house supervised learning system. Designed the
  data IO and caching subsystem, contributed to feature engineering and learning frameworks,
  parallelization, vectorization and debugging of learning algorithms: SDCA, LBFGS, AGAGRAD,
  Factorization Machines.
\end{itemize*}

\leftandright{Spire Global, Inc}{San Francisco, CA} \\
\leftandrighti{Software Engineer}{May - October 2014}
